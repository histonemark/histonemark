### Hola there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Marc Corrales, A postdoc researcher at [Laboratory of Molecular biology (LMB)](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)

ðŸ”­ I am interested in understanding the evolution of nervous systems, particularly the centers for associative memory.

I work in [Albert Cadona's lab](https://syn.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/index.html) where we use focused-ion-beam scanning-electron-microscopes modified by [Shan Xu](https://www.janelia.org/open-science/enhanced-fib-sem) to acquire brain synaptic resolution volumes, or connectomes, that we register, reconstruct and annotate with the lab-developped software [CATMAID](https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID).
